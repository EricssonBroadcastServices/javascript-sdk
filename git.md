## Working with git
### Branches
All features and fixes should be developed on branches following the naming convention type/description, i.e: feat/add-new-player or fix/add-missing-player-option.

### Commit messages.
We use convetional commits in all javascript project. https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

### Pull requests
When finished with a feature or fix, create a pull request to the main/master branch and requests reviews from at least 2 colleagues.

#### Merging pull requests
Once the pull request is approved, merge it to the master branch using "squash and merge". This created on single commit message in the main/master branch for the entire feature, thus keeping the git history clean and readable.
